# Rice-Factor Capability Registry
# Defines which refactoring operations are supported for each programming language.
#
# Operation values:
#   true    - Fully supported
#   false   - Not supported
#   partial - Limited support (treated as false in strict mode)
#
# This is the bundled default. Projects can override by placing a file at:
#   tools/registry/capability_registry.yaml
#
# Schema: docs/milestones/05-executor-engine/requirements.md Section 4.2
